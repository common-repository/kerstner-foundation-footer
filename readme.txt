The Kerstner Foundation (Kerstner.org) offers FREE Web Hosting to nonprofits. To qualify you must install and activate this plugin.

== Description ==

One of the many free services the *[Kerstner Foundation](http://kerstner.org/)* offers is [FREE Web Hosting for Nonprofits](http://kerstner.org/services/free-website-hosting-for-nonprofits/). If you’re a nonprofit that qualifies you get free web/email/database/backup hosting **free of charge** essentially indefinitely as long as you keep this plugin activated and your nonprofit doesn’t engage in anything unethical.

*Currently the Kerstner Foundation hosts over 1500 nonprofits free of charge!*

[**You can apply for free web hosting here**](http://kerstner.org/funding-application/).

Although the hosting is 100% free, you are on the same [enterprise infrastructure](http://kerstner.org/philanthropy/free-enterprise-hosting/) that our hosting partner, [Hosted Fusion](http://hostedfusion.com/), uses to host some of the largest companies on earth. All of their multiple data centers throughout the world are *fully redundant* in every way possible.

*E.g. We’ve had nonprofits we host be on shows like "Oprah" where millions of people visited their site over a matter of hours and we were completely fine handling the spike in traffic.*

= About Our Free Hosting Package =

Here is just a brief list of the features you get with free web hosting:

*   Unlimited bandwidth
*   Unlimited storage
*   Unlimited MySQL databases
*   Unlimited email accounts
*   Unlimited nightly automated backups
*   A 24/7 veteran support staff that ensures 99.999% uptime

= About the Kerstner Foundation =

The Kerstner Foundation was formed in early 2006 when successful young entrepreneur [Chris Kerstner](http://chriskerstner.com/) decided that charging nonprofits for marketing, PR and website related services, such as web design and web hosting was unethical. 
He recognized that every dollar nonprofits spend on these services was one less dollar they could spend on their charitable cause.

Owning his own marketing and web services company, Chris decided to create the Kerstner Foundation and offer all these services free of charge indefinitely to qualified nonprofits that believed in making the world a better place. *NOTE: The Kerstner Foundation is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit.*

= The Kerstner Foundation Also Offers the Following Services =

All services are 100% free of charge to qualified nonprofits:

*   Free Website Design
*   Free Web Hosting 
*   Free Marketing 
*   Free PR
*   Grants

*[You can apply for any of the above services here](http://kerstner.org/funding-application/).*

== Installation ==

1. Upload `kerstner-foundation-footer.3.9.1.zip` directly to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do you require your footer on our website, are you just advertising? =

*No, not at all!* The reason the footer is required is our partner company providing the free hosting writes off the very large expenses associated with hosting 1000’s of sites for free. The write off is large enough that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) frequently audits them requiring proof of all sites they host. The footer acts as this proof if the IRS is inclined to look into things.

= If I disable the plugin will I be charged for web hosting? =

No, but you will be ineligible to receive free hosting going forward. You will be notified of this and have 1 week to enable the plugin – If you do not enable it within this grace period your hosting will be disabled.

= Will the footer display on every page? =

Yes it will, in very small text on the bottom of each page. We try to make it as inconspicuous as possible.

= What will the footer say? =

The actual text varies from time to time but here is a sample: `"Free web hosting for nonprofits by Kerstner.org"`.
